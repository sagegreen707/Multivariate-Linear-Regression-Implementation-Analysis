# Multivariate-Linear-Regression-Implementation-Analysis
This repository contains an implementation of Multivariate Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for modeling relationships between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. The project includes theoretical insights, implementation from scratch, and evaluation using real-world data.

Features:
Implementation of Multivariate Linear Regression from scratch and using scikit-learn
Gradient Descent and Normal Equation approaches
Feature scaling (Standardization & Normalization) for improved performance
Cost function visualization and convergence analysis
Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score, and Residual Analysis
